# Pandas-Learning
In this analysis, I created a sample dataset using Python's pandas and numpy libraries. I first set a random seed for reproducibility and created a DataFrame with columns for ID, Name, Age, Salary, and Department. The dataset was then explored with various functions. I displayed the first few rows using .head(), and for a statistical overview, I used .describe() to generate summary statistics. I filtered rows where 'Age' was greater than 30 using conditional selection and calculated the average salary by grouping the data by 'Department' with .groupby(). The 'Salary' column was renamed to 'Income' with .rename(), and I added a new 'Bonus' column. I also replaced values in the 'Department' column with .replace() and converted all department names to uppercase using .str.upper().
