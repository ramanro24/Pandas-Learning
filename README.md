# Pandas-Learning for data manipulation #
In the analysis with a file named as Pandas_learning for data manipulation, I created a sample dataset using Python's pandas and numpy libraries. I started by setting a random seed for reproducibility and created a DataFrame with columns for ID, Name, Age, Salary, and Department. The dataset was then explored using various functions. I displayed the first few rows using .head() and generated summary statistics with .describe() to gain a statistical overview. I filtered rows where 'Age' was greater than 30 using conditional selection and calculated the average salary by grouping the data by 'Department' with .groupby(). I also renamed the 'Salary' column to 'Income' using .rename(), added a new 'Bonus' column, replaced values in the 'Department' column with .replace(), and converted all department names to uppercase with .str.upper().

# Pandas Learning Using Pizza Datasets #
Based on the work I've done in the project in pizza dataset so far, here’s a summary of my progress. I began by importing the necessary libraries, including numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn, to help with the analysis. Then, I loaded the dataset from an Excel file (pizza.xlsx) using pd.read_excel(). During the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, I performed basic data inspection by displaying the first few and last few rows of the dataset using .head() and .tail(). I checked the dataset's dimensions with .shape, revealing a total of 48,620 rows and 12 columns. To gather more details about the columns, data types, and null values, I used the .info() function, and summarized the numerical columns using .describe().

Next, I checked for missing values using .count() and confirmed there were no missing values, as each column had 48,620 non-null entries. For data selection and slicing, I extracted specific columns such as pizza_name_id, and selected multiple columns like ['pizza_name_id', 'quantity', 'unit_price', 'total_price', 'pizza_size']. I retrieved individual rows with data.iloc[0] and slices of rows with data.iloc[0:3]. Additionally, I sliced specific columns using data.iloc[:, [1, 3, 5, 6]], focusing on order_id, quantity, order_time, and unit_price.

For the next steps, I could proceed with data cleaning, visualization, or statistical analysis. I could also perform aggregations, such as calculating sales per pizza type or analyzing revenue trends over time. Let me know what I’d like to focus on next!

# Pandas Learning 2: # 

In Pandas Learning 2, I practiced essential Pandas operations through multiple data scenarios, focusing on real-world applications. I analyzed student performance data, identifying high scorers, calculating grade averages, and assigning pass/fail labels. In sales data, I computed revenue, ranked top-selling products, and summarized monthly totals. The employee dataset was used for salary analysis, departmental grouping, and calculating years to retirement. Additionally, I worked with store reviews, detecting low-rated products, categorizing ratings, and analyzing customer feedback. Through these exercises, I strengthened my understanding of filtering, grouping, aggregation, column transformations, and data categorization, reinforcing key data manipulation techniques.
