# Pandas-Learning
In the analysis, I created a sample dataset using Python's pandas and numpy libraries. I started by setting a random seed for reproducibility and created a DataFrame with columns for ID, Name, Age, Salary, and Department. The dataset was then explored using various functions. I displayed the first few rows using .head() and generated summary statistics with .describe() to gain a statistical overview. I filtered rows where 'Age' was greater than 30 using conditional selection and calculated the average salary by grouping the data by 'Department' with .groupby(). I also renamed the 'Salary' column to 'Income' using .rename(), added a new 'Bonus' column, replaced values in the 'Department' column with .replace(), and converted all department names to uppercase with .str.upper().

Based on the work I've done in the project in pizza dataset so far, here’s a summary of my progress. I began by importing the necessary libraries, including numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn, to help with the analysis. Then, I loaded the dataset from an Excel file (pizza.xlsx) using pd.read_excel(). During the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, I performed basic data inspection by displaying the first few and last few rows of the dataset using .head() and .tail(). I checked the dataset's dimensions with .shape, revealing a total of 48,620 rows and 12 columns. To gather more details about the columns, data types, and null values, I used the .info() function, and summarized the numerical columns using .describe().

Next, I checked for missing values using .count() and confirmed there were no missing values, as each column had 48,620 non-null entries. For data selection and slicing, I extracted specific columns such as pizza_name_id, and selected multiple columns like ['pizza_name_id', 'quantity', 'unit_price', 'total_price', 'pizza_size']. I retrieved individual rows with data.iloc[0] and slices of rows with data.iloc[0:3]. Additionally, I sliced specific columns using data.iloc[:, [1, 3, 5, 6]], focusing on order_id, quantity, order_time, and unit_price.

For the next steps, I could proceed with data cleaning, visualization, or statistical analysis. I could also perform aggregations, such as calculating sales per pizza type or analyzing revenue trends over time. Let me know what I’d like to focus on next!
